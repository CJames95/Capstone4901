	{"text": "Consistency and Standards is exactly as it sounds - be consistent and keep in line with industry standards. Users should be secure in the knowledge that functionalities of the same name/nature will work similarly across platforms."},
	{"text": "For example, many games will assign certain controls to the same buttons across a console. Imagine an Xbox game that assigns the 'jump' input to the right trigger, when the standard is the 'A' or 'Y' button. Users would immediately take issue with this, and the game would suffer."},
